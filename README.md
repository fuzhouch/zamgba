# Introduction

[Zamgba](https://github.com/fuzhouch/zamgba) is a project to learn
how to program for [Game Boy Advance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Boy_Advance).
My goal is to see whether I can use Game Boy Advance as a target platform to
develop my own video gamed as hobby.

The motivation was brought when I learn [TIC-80](https://tic80.com), a
popular open source virtual console. Though I love the idea behind
(which was indeed brought by
[PICO-8](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php)), that a virtual console
should include all tools needed for development, it also brings a
limitation, that it is not easy to make use of modern
graphics or music composing tools, such as
[Asprite](https://www.aseprite.org)
or [Famistudio](https://www.famistudio.org/).
Besides, I would like to program targeting a true hardware instead of
using a high-level scripting language from a virtual console.

[Game Boy Advance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Boy_Advance) has
been a popular gaming hardware since I was a kid.
Though it has reached end-of-life for a long time, there are many
games available. People play them on real hardwares (GBA, GBA SP,
Nintendo DS or 3DS), hardware simulator
([Analogue Pocket](https://www.analogue.co) or software emulators
(either via desktop or many retro handheld devices). And unlike
virtual consoles,
[Game Boy Advance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Boy_Advance)
is based on real ARM processor. The knowledge of hardware programming
 is still useful.

Overall, [Game Boy Advance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Boy_Advance)
appears to be a better target platform than virtual console for me to
create 2D based, retro style game for fun.

## The programming languages

I use [Zig programming language](https://ziglang.org) to construct my
project. Zig is a low-level language just like C, but it comes with many
language constructs to prevent memory bugs. Meanwhile, Zig comes with a
perfect compiler toolchain, which keeps cross-compiling in mind from
the first day.


## How can I (as a reader) use the project

Nothing for now. This is a self-learning session to study the classic
[tonc](https://www.coranac.com/tonc/text/toc.htm) tutorial. The basic
content is indeed a set of example code following the tutorial. It is
neither a game, nor a new emulator, or existing rom hack.
If you are interested in how to learn hardware oriented programming via
Zig, you may (eventually) find something useful eventually. :)

Tough it sounds completely useless for now, it may change in the future.
If I happen to figure out a clear direction, I will update this
documentation and make it official.
