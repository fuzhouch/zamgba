[Zamgba](https://github.com/fuzhouch/zamgba) is a project to learn
how to program for [Game Boy Advance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Boy_Advance).
My goal is to use Game Boy Advance as a target platform to
develop my own video gamed as hobby.

The motivation was brought when I learn [TIC-80](https://tic80.com), a
popular open source fantasy console. I love the idea behind
(which was indeed brought by
[PICO-8](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php)), that a fantasy console
should include all tools needed for development. However, it brings a
limitation, that it is not easy to make use of modern
graphics or music composing tools into development workflow, such as
[Asprite](https://www.aseprite.org)
or [Famistudio](https://www.famistudio.org/).
Besides, I would like to program targeting a true hardware with
low-level concepts (e.g. IRQs.). A high-level
scripting language used by fantasy console does not allow me do this.

[Game Boy Advance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Boy_Advance) has
been a popular gaming hardware since I was a kid.
Though it has reached end-of-life for a long time, there are many
games available. People play them on real hardwares (GBA, GBA SP,
Nintendo DS or 3DS), hardware simulator
([Analogue Pocket](https://www.analogue.co) or emulators
(either via desktop or many retro handheld devices). Unlike
fantasy consoles,
[Game Boy Advance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Boy_Advance)
is based on real ARM processor. The knowledge of hardware programming
is still useful nowadays.

Overall, [Game Boy Advance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Boy_Advance)
appears to be a better target platform than fantasy console for me to
create 2D based, retro style game for fun.

## The programming languages

I use [Zig programming language](https://ziglang.org) to construct my
project. Zig is a low-level language just like C, but it comes with many
language constructs to prevent memory bugs. Meanwhile, Zig comes with a
perfect compiler toolchain, which keeps cross-compiling in mind from
the first day.


## How can I (as a reader) use the project

With **v0.1.0**, Zamgba is ready as an early, open-source SDK and lightweight 2D engine for learning and creating Game Boy Advance programs in pure Zig.

You can use this project to:
1. **Learn GBA Hardware Programming**: Explore how GBA MMIO registers, VRAM, and OAM can be mapped cleanly into type-safe Zig constructs without fragile C pointer arithmetic.
2. **Build Your Own GBA Demos & Games**: Use the built-in HAL and engine loop to write your own ROMs, test 2D collisions, and run them on real hardware or emulators like mGBA.
3. **Reference as a Dependency**: Integrate Zamgba into your own external game repository using git submodules (see `consumezamgba` below).

*Note*: As of v0.1.0, this is an early developer preview. It is great for small retro games (like Pong), tech demos, and learning bare-metal development, but not yet intended for full commercial productions. Feedback, suggestions, and PRs are welcome!

## ...But I'm a hacker!

Well, if you are also interested programming GBA in Zig, follow the
steps below:

1. Install Zig. The codebase is compiled with Zig version **0.16.0** or later.
2. Clone [Zamgba](https://github.com/fuzhouch/zamgba) source code.
3. Build with command: `zig build`. You will get the compiled demo ROM binaries inside `zig-out/bin/` (e.g., `zig-out/bin/sprite_engine.gba`).
4. Run any ROM using an emulator. For example: `mgba ./zig-out/bin/sprite_engine.gba`.
5. For debugging, use `mgba -d ./zig-out/bin/sprite_engine.gba`. It's a powerful assembly debugging tool to solve a lot of problems.

## Built-In Demo ROMs

Zamgba includes several interactive and instructional demo ROMs categorised by abstraction layers:

### 1. Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) Demos
*   **`mode3_lines`** (`demo/hal/mode3_lines.zig`): Demonstrates basic Mode 3 bitmap graphics. Renders three intersecting colored lines on a bitmap background using low-level, context-agnostic line-drawing algorithms.
*   **`sprite_hal`** (`demo/hal/sprite_hal.zig`): Demonstrates direct, register-level sprite setup on the GBA. Manually populates palette memory (PALRAM) and sprite tile memory (VRAM), configures packed `ObjAttr` coordinates, and bounces a single white 8x8 block smoothly left-to-right inside a VBlank-synchronized loop.

### 2. High-Level Engine Demos
*   **`sprite_engine`** (`demo/engine/sprite_engine.zig`): Showcases our high-level **Static Namespace / File** engine loop. State is declared cleanly as file-scope `var` variables, and the loop is started via `engine.run(@This())`. The engine automatically manages VBlank timing, OAM hardware uploads, and dynamic slot allocation.
*   **`sprite_instanced`** (`demo/engine/sprite_instanced.zig`): Showcases our high-level **Pointer-to-Instance** engine loop. Encapsulates the entire game state inside a type-safe structure (`const Game = struct { ... }`) and passes an instance pointer `engine.run(&game)`. This is the recommended structure for larger, multi-sprite/multi-level modular games requiring state serialization (SRAM/Flash cartridge saving).
*   **`joypad_instanced`** (`demo/engine/joypad_instanced.zig`): Demonstrates high-level sprite movement via D-pad input using engine-layer APIs. Changes sprite color dynamically upon hitting screen boundaries (Top: Red, Bottom: White, Left: Yellow, Right: Green).
*   **`collision_demo`** (`demo/engine/collision_demo.zig`): Demonstrates the 2D physics engine, AABB collision detection, and `CollisionMap` streaming. Features a player square responding to D-pad inputs, two bouncing patrol enemies, and game state reset upon collision.
*   **`flappy_tsetseg`** (`demo/engine/flappy_tsetseg.zig`): Demonstrates animated multi-frame 8-bpp sprite playback with static all-frame VRAM preloading.
*   **`flappy_tsetseg_streaming`** (`demo/engine/flappy_tsetseg_streaming.zig`): Demonstrates high-performance VRAM Streaming sprite animation. Only a single 32x32 frame slot (1 KB) is allocated via `VramAllocator`; subsequent frames stream asynchronously from ROM into VRAM via `AnimatedSprite` and `DmaQueue` during VBlank.
*   **`pong`** (`demo/engine/pong.zig`): A complete, playable classic Pong game built entirely on `zamgba-engine`. Features player paddle D-pad controls, AI paddle tracking, top/bottom wall reflections, AABB paddle-ball collision response, and scoring/resets.

### Can I reference your library as a dependency?

Yes. Please check the example at: https://github.com/fuzhouch/consumezamgba.

You can manage Zamgba as a dependency via git submodule or standard package workflows.

The example project shows three steps to enable your project building a GBA ROM:

1. ``build.zig`` calls ``@import("zamgba").arm.addROM()`` to define
   a target. The API defines proper target to build code targeting
   ARM7tdmi. It also defines step to do ``objcopy``, which is required
   to convert built ELF file to an ``.gba`` image that can be recognized
   by mgba.
2. In source code, define a ``gameHeader`` to register GBA rom header
   required by GBA device. It must be done by calling
   ``@import("zamgba").setupROMHeader()``.
3. Define main() function entry point with ``export`` keyword. It is
   required by ``zamgba`` to locate the entry point while booting.


Enjoy!
